# Ham-Fisted
Built on Unity 2021.3.9f1 using URP, the Input System, and Cinemachine.
# The Project
This was my first real project that was not a class assignment. Originally, it was for school in the [first version](https://github.com/JeffcoatDesign/Ham-Fisted), however it became much larger, due to earning a spot to represent student work at Embry-Riddle's GDC Play booth in 2023. In order to prepare for the expo, my partner and I added new music, animations, textures, and more.
